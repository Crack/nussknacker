#Why Nussknacker?

##Make power of Apache Flink accessible to business users.

Realtime data processing quickly becomes one of key ingredients of marketing, monitoring or fraud detection.
The ability to ingest large amounts of data within (mili)seconds, to process them and draw actionable insights can become
real competitive advantage. 

One the most advanced platforms for stream processing is Apache Flink. It allows users to process
millions of events per second and process them without losing even one. 
Flink offers unmatched richness of Scala/Java API for performing filtering, enrichment and sophisticated aggregations. 

However, many use cases involve processes that would be best defined or changed by not-so-technical users 
\- anylysts or business people. Furthermore, many companies do not have large enough development teams 
to be able to define all processes with code. 
 
This is where Nussknacker kicks in.

##Flow
We strongly believe that 'zero-code' platforms are a humbug. For each deployment, some development effort
is needed to define model, integrations with external systems and so on. 
This step includes development and produces jar with model and defined services. Read 
[API](API.md) section to learn how to define model classes and integrations.

Once those artifacts are defined and installed in Nusskracker installation, semi-technical users
will be able to define specific processes using [GUI](DesigningProcesses.md). 


##Applications

Real time event processing is crucial in many area. Below are sample use cases:

* Real time marketing
* Fraud detection
* Streaming ETL
* Traffic data
